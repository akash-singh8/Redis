# Redis

Redis can be used as a cache to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need to repeatedly query a database.

## Here's how the caching process works using Redis:

1. Without Redis Caching:

  - User sends a request to the server.
  - Server queries the database to fetch the required data.
  - Server processes the data and sends a response back to the user.

If the same data is requested by multiple users or the same user again, the server will need to repeat the database query process, potentially slowing down the response time.


2. With Redis Caching:

  - User sends a request to the server.
  - Server checks if the required data is already stored in the Redis cache.
  - If the data is found in the cache, the server retrieves it directly from Redis and sends a response back to the user.
  - If the data is not found in the cache, the server queries the database, stores the data in Redis, and then sends the response to the user.

Subsequent requests for the same data can now be served directly from the Redis cache, eliminating the need to query the database again.

By using Redis as a cache, we can significantly reduce the number of database queries and speed up the response times of our application. This is especially effective for scenarios where the data doesn't change frequently or where certain data is accessed very frequently.
